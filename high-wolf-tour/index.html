With a new album ‘Know Thyself’ on Sun Araw’s Sun Ark label and upcoming music on Not Not Fun, High Wolf’s miasmic loops and drones will be rolling across the country with a special appearance at Newcastle’s Sound Summit. Supports include Rites Wild, Secret Birds and more to be confirmed.

“France’s High Wolf possesses a natural-born ability to produce tones most conducive to inducing transcendental states. Prolific without wearing out his welcome, the guitarist and effects box manipulator sets loose fervid streams of fever-dream drones. High Wolf’s tracks sound as if they’ve been sluicing since the beginning of time, siphoned for teasingly brief absorption before they shimmer off to the vanishing point.” midheaven.com

In between Herzog's Aguirre and Levi Strauss' Sad Tropics, mysterious and psychoactive, High Wolf's music mixes cosmic loops, fuzzy guitars, droney synths, mystic vocals and tribal percussion, inspired by primitive and ritual music as well as adventurous modern music.

A hyperactive artist continuously on the move all around the globe, High Wolf has never stopped producing and collaborating, since his inception in 2009. Starting with his first tape, HW has had an ongoing relationship with the influential Californian label Not Not Fun.

Other releases on the label include a 7" and debut LP in 2010, a tape in 2011 and another LP planned for 2012.

In 2011 another American label, Holy Mountain (Om, James Ferraro) released his second Lp album entitled "Atlas Nation".

“Atlas Nation—recorded in 2010 after a long trip to India and Nepal—deepens High Wolf’s penetration into the mystic. “The Dawn of Man” is a stark, stoned processional burrowing into malarial climes where guitars squawk in ominous tongues and congas cave in chests and clear brush with a vengeance. “Raagni” magnifies and psychedelicizes Rapoon’s mantric, ritualistic hand-drum patter and tropical-forest drones while hinting at Don Cherry’s jazz-raga peregrinations. High Wolf claims that “Haiti” was “recorded in a couple of hours [on] the day of the big earthquake in Haiti, so it's the darkest/saddest HW track ever.” It’s a fittingly miasmic, climactic threnody. “ - holymountain.com

“Ascension is a title that indicates an upward trajectory, and the material on offer here is certainly a big step forward for High Wolf. Mastered by the accomplished hands of Pete Swanson (Yellow Swans), High Wolf’s loop-heavy, highly meditative pieces have an impressive sheen not present on past releases. A track like “Diego” falls somewhere between Stellar Om Source and Sun Araw, with more clarity of individual sound elements than either. It’s a heady number with a surprising breakbeat buried deep in the mix.” -tinymixtapes
